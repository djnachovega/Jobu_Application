Jobu NFL Algorithm – v4.0R1 (Comprehensive Home/Away Analytics)

**Task:** Run the enhanced Jobu NFL Algorithm using the complete Home/Away statistical database. Team listed first = Away, second = Home. Evaluate Spread, Moneyline, Total, 1H, and Team Totals with advanced splits analysis.

### 🔹 **Enhanced Data Integration**

**Home/Away Splits Priority**
* Use **Home** stats for home teams, **Away** stats for away teams as primary inputs
* Apply **55% weight to venue-specific splits**, 35% to 2025 season totals, 10% to Last 3 games
* For teams with limited home/away sample: empirical Bayes shrink toward season means

**Comprehensive Statistical Layers**
1. **Core Efficiency Matrix**
   - Points Per Play (Home/Away splits)
   - Yards Per Play (Home/Away splits) 
   - Opponent PPP & YPP (Home/Away defensive splits)
   - First Downs Per Play (drive sustainability)

2. **Pace & Possession Framework**
   - Plays Per Game (Home/Away tempo)
   - Opponent Plays Per Game (defensive pace control)
   - Expected Possessions = min(Team Plays, Opp Plays Allowed) **with venue adjustment**

3. **Situational Execution Stack**
   - **Red Zone Efficiency**: Scoring % (Home/Away) + Opponent RZ Defense
   - **Down Conversion**: 3rd/4th Down % (O/D) with venue splits
   - **Field Position**: Yards Per Punt Attempt + Kickoff Touchback %
   - **Field Goal Efficiency**: Points Per Attempt (both teams)

4. **Play-Type & Matchup Analysis**
   - Pass Play % vs Opponent Pass Defense %
   - Yards Per Pass Attempt vs Opponent YPPA
   - Yards Per Rush Attempt vs Opponent YPRA
   - QB Sack % vs Opponent Sack % (pressure differential)

5. **Discipline & Hidden Yards**
   - Penalty Yards Per Game (Home/Away)
   - Penalty First Downs Per Game
   - Yards Per Penalty
   - Penalty Per Play rate

### 🔹 **Enhanced Modeling Rules**

**Composite Rating System**
```
Offensive Rating = (60% PPP + 40% YPP) × Situational Multipliers
Defensive Rating = (60% Opp PPP + 40% Opp YPP) × Situational Multipliers

Situational Multipliers:
- RZ Efficiency: 1.0 + (Team RZ% - League Avg) × 0.5
- 3rd Down Efficiency: 1.0 + (3D% - League Avg) × 0.3  
- Penalty Impact: 1.0 - (Penalty Yds/G Differential ÷ 50) × 0.1
```

**Possession & Tempo Modeling**
```
Expected Possessions = min(
  Team Plays (venue-adjusted), 
  Opponent Plays Allowed (venue-adjusted)
)

If |spread| ≤ 3 → apply 15% pace reduction
If weather wind ≥ 12 mph → apply 20% pace reduction
```

**Scoring Projection Engine**
```
Team Projected Points = 
  (Offensive Rating × Expected Possessions × 0.85) +
  (Defensive Rating Differential × 2.5) +
  Special Teams Contribution +
  Penalty Impact Adjustment
```

### 🔹 **Advanced Matchup Analysis**

**Passing Game Matchup**
```
Passing Edge = (Team YPA - Opponent YPPA Allowed) × Pass Play %
If differential > +1.0 → boost projection by 3-7%
If differential < -1.0 → reduce projection by 3-7%
```

**Rushing Game Matchup**  
```
Rushing Edge = (Team YPR - Opponent YPRA Allowed) × (1 - Pass Play %)
Apply similar adjustment scale as passing
```

**Pressure Differential**
```
Sack Rate Gap = (Opponent Sack % - Team Sack % Allowed)
If gap > +3% → reduce disadvantaged QB projection by 2-4%
```

---

### 🔹 **Enhanced Risk Framework**

**Volatility Factors (V-Score 0-100)**
- **QB Stability**: Sack rate differential + recent performance variance
- **Penalty Discipline**: Yards per game differential > 15 = +10 V-Score
- **Red Zone Consistency**: Home/Away RZ% variance > 20% = +15 V-Score  
- **Pace Volatility**: Home/Away plays variance > 8 = +12 V-Score
- **Special Teams**: Punt/KO efficiency bottom-10 = +8 V-Score

**Weather Gates (Enhanced)**
- Wind 12-18 mph: Reduce totals by 3-4 points, require +4 pt edge
- Wind 18+ mph: Reduce totals by 5-7 points, pivot to unders/team totals
- Rain: Reduce passing efficiency by 15-25%, boost rushing projections

```

**Key Matchup Drivers**
1. **[Home/Road Splits]**: Home team +12% PPP at home vs away
2. **[Pressure Differential]**: Home team sack advantage +2.3%
3. **[Pace Control]**: Away team forces 2.2 fewer opponent plays on road  
4. **[Red Zone Defense]**: Home team allows 58% RZ scoring vs 67% on road

**✅ Enhanced Pick Format**
```
Play: [Market & Side] — to [Price/Number]
Confidence: High/Medium/Lean (V=##)
Edge: +X.X% | Volatility: Low/Medium/High

Why:
• [Primary Driver] – Home/Road efficiency gap + venue-specific execution
• [Matchup Edge] – Passing game advantage vs weak secondary (YPPA diff: +1.2)
• [Situational Factor] – Penalty discipline favors home team (-8 yds/gm)
• [Pace/Tempo] – Expected possession advantage +2.3%

Kill Switches: QB status change, weather deterioration, line movement >7¢
Derivatives: Team Total Over [Number] (edge: +Y.Y%)
```

### 🔹 **Quality Gates (Enhanced)**

**Data Quality Checks**
- Home/Away sample ≥ 3 games for split usage
- Cross-validate possession math: (Plays + Opp Plays) ÷ 2 = 24-32 range
- Verify special teams data completeness
- Flag teams with >20% home/away efficiency variance

**Play Qualification**
```
Sides: ≥ 3% price edge AND V-Score ≤ 75
Totals: ≥ 3.5 pt cushion AND V-Score ≤ 70
Team Totals: ≥ 4 pt cushion AND matchup-specific rationale
High-Volatility (V≥65): Require +1% additional edge
```

**Market Movement Protocol**
- Drift > 8¢ without news: Reduce position size 50%
- Drift > 12¢: PASS regardless of edge
- Correlated plays: Max 2 related positions per game

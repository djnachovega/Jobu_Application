Jobu NBA Algorithm – v3.5R1 (Daily Run)  

Task: Run the Jobu NBA Basketball Algorithm on the attached slate of games.  Team listed first = Away, second = Home. Evaluate Spread, Moneyline, and Totals. Return only price-disciplined edges with strong modeled probability advantage.

🔹 Core Configuration
Primary Data Sources (authority order):
1. Attached NBA Sheets – canonical ( Season Stats and Home/Away splits where it makes sense).
2. Pull Externals via Web Search for Situational/context overlays (travel distance, rest/B2B, altitude, whistle bias), Opponent-adjusted SoS correction, Live market/juice sweep.
3. Markets: TeamRankings, Covers, or VegasInsider (current odds).
4. Injuries/Rotations: Rotowire, Covers, or reliable depth charts.
5. Venue Context: pace, travel distance, altitude.
Treat attached data as truth. If a field missing → shrink to season baseline (no fabrication). Use short-name team mapping for joins.

🔹 Modeling Framework (Jobu Suite NBA Core)
Component	Weight	Description
Efficiency	55–60%	Off/Def Efficiency (PPP / ORtg / DRtg), eFG%, TOV%, ORB%, FTr (venue-conditioned).
Pace / Possessions	15–20%	Possessions per game & opponent possessions per game (venue-conditioned).
Usage / Availability	10–15%	Player minutes, injuries, rotation depth, and key on/off impact.
Situational / Contextual	~10%	Travel, rest days, altitude, foul rate, free-throw variance.
Blend Conditioning (Efficiency & Pace Layers):
* 55% Home/Away Split
* 35% Season Baseline
* 10% Last-3 Usage Overlay (rotation / minutes recency only) If sample < 3 games → shrink toward season baseline.
Strength of Schedule: Apply opponent-adjusted efficiency correction (TeamRankings SoS or opponent-adj ORtg/DRtg).

🔹 Calculation Sequence
1. Baseline Build: Construct Offense & Defense expectations from PPP (Points per Possession) and Four-Factors (eFG%, TOV%, ORB%, FTr) using the 55/35/10 blend.
2. Pace / Possessions Estimation: Combine team pace and opponent pace, apply home/away modifier, produce expected possessions per side.
3. Situational Overlays: Include rest/travel fatigue, foul differential, tempo bias, and free-throw rate tilt.
4. SoS Adjustment: Opponent-adjust both efficiency layers (lighter weight).
5. Simulation & Pricing: Drive possession-based simulation → mean & distribution for points. Convert to Fair Spread, Fair Total, Fair ML. Compare vs market → mark EdgeScore.
6. Volatility Scoring (V 0–100):
    * From usage uncertainty, pace variance, and foul volatility.
    * V ≥65: downgrade confidence.
    * V ≥80: exclude from “Absolute Best.”

🔹 Required Inputs (Populate & Display)
Pace & Volume
* Possessions per Game, Opponent Possessions per Game (H/A + last-3).
Efficiency (Offense/Defense)
* Offensive/Defensive PPP (H/A + Season).
* Four Factors (eFG%, TOV%, ORB%, FTr).
* Red Zone analogs → Rim Finishing %, 3P Rate/3P%, FT Rate.
Usage / Availability
* Key player minutes, injuries, foul issues, recent minute shifts.
* On/off PPP deltas if provided in sheet.
Situational
* Travel distance, rest days, back-to-back flags, altitude.
Market Snapshot
* Current Spread / ML / Total and juice.

✅ Picks (Price-Sensitive)

Play: <market side/total> — to <price>
Confidence: High / Medium / Lean (V=<##>)
Why:
• [Driver 1 – e.g., eFG% & pace edge at venue]
• [Driver 2 – e.g., ORB% advantage vs weak defensive rebounding]
• [Driver 3 – e.g., SoS correction or foul differential tilt]
Guardrails
* PASS if |Fair − Market| ≥ 9 and V ≥ 60.
* Maintain price discipline (no chasing beyond “to” number).
* “Absolute Best” only if EdgeScore ≥ 4% and V < 55.

🔹 Example (Structure Only)

Play: Over 226.5 — to −115  
Confidence: Medium (V=47)  
Why:
• Combined projected 72.4 poss (+8% vs league avg)  
• Both teams top-10 in Off eFG% and FT Rate → elevated efficiency  
• Thin defensive rotations (foul risk) → pace likely sustained

Jobu CBB Algorithm – v3.6R1 (Home/Away + Regression • Daily Run) 
Task: Run the Jobu College Basketball Algorithm on the attached slate of games. Team listed first = Away, second = Home. Evaluate Spread, Moneyline, and Totals. Return only price-disciplined edges with strong modeled probability advantage.

🔹 Core Configuration
Primary Data Sources (authority order):
1. Attached CBB Home/Away Split Sheet – canonical
    * Home/Away: ORtg, DRtg, PPP, pace, 4 Factors (eFG%, TOV%, ORB%, FTr)
    * 3P% / 3P rate, Rim finishing%, FT% / FTr
    * Strength of Schedule / opponent tiers (if present)
    * Rolling windows (L5 / L10) where available
2. Markets: TeamRankings, Covers, VegasInsider (current odds: Spread, ML, Total).
3. Injuries/Rotations: Rotowire, Covers, or reliable depth charts.
4. Venue Context:
    * Home / Away / Neutral flag
    * Travel distance, rest days, altitude
    * Tournament vs regular-season (conf tourneys / MTEs vs true home)
Data Protocol
* Treat the attached sheet as truth for team strength and pace.
* If a field is missing → shrink to season baseline or league average. No fabrication.
* Use short-name team mapping (e.g., “W Kentucky,” “J Madison”) for joins.
* For early season (low game counts), empirical-Bayes shrink all splits toward:
    * Season baseline, then
    * Conference or national averages if sample is extremely thin.

🔹 Modeling Framework (Jobu Suite CBB Core v3.6R1)
Component	Weight	Description
Efficiency	50–55%	Off/Def PPP / ORtg / DRtg, 4 Factors (eFG%, TOV%, ORB%, FTr), venue-conditioned
Pace / Possessions	15–20%	Possessions per game & opponent possessions per game, with style-clash logic
Usage / Availability	10–15%	Minutes, injuries, rotation depth, key on/off impact (top 6–7 rotation only)
FT / 3P Regression	5–10%	Shooting regression for 3P% & FT%, home/road splits, rim vs 3P mix
Situational / Context	~10%	Travel, rest days, altitude, foul rate, small-conference volatility
Blend Conditioning (Efficiency & Pace Layers)
* 55% Home/Away Split
* 30% Season Baseline
* 15% Rolling (Last-5 / Last-10) usage + efficiency overlay (if available)
* If split sample < 3 home or road games → shrink aggressively toward season baseline.
* For November / early-season games with very low sample sizes:
    * Cap venue-specific influence at ≤40% of total blend.
Strength of Schedule (SoS)
* Use your sheet’s SoS / opponent-adjusted ORtg/DRtg if present:
    * Adjust offensive and defensive efficiency with a light correction (e.g., ±3–7%).
* If external SoS (KenPom/Torvik) is used, treat it as a secondary correction, never a primary driver.
* Distinguish non-conference SoS vs conference SoS when available; in March, lean more on conference-era SoS for in-league matchups and full-season SoS for cross-conference/NCAA games.

🔹 Venue & Neutral-Court Logic
* Home game:
    * Use Home splits (ORtg/DRtg, 4 factors) as the main 55% layer.
* Road game:
    * Use Away splits as main 55% layer.
* Neutral court (MTEs, conference tournaments, March):
    * Start from Season baseline (50%) + H/A splits (50% evenly).
    * Apply small travel + unfamiliar gym penalty to both offenses unless the sheet flags prior neutral performance.
    * Reduce HCA swing in foul rate / FT Rate vs true home games.
* Quasi-Home Neutral (Conference / NCAA):
    * If the “neutral” site is within a short distance of one campus or clearly favors one fanbase (same state/metro region), treat it as:
        * Home-court lite:
            * 35–40% weight to that team’s Home split,
            * 35–40% to Season baseline,
            * 20–30% to Away split.
        * Allow a small HCA bump in foul rate / FT Rate and late-game win prob, but smaller than true home.
    * If both teams are far from home and crowd split is even → keep pure neutral logic as above.

🔹 Calculation Sequence
1. Baseline Efficiency Build
    * For each team:
        * Construct Offense & Defense expectations from PPP / ORtg / DRtg and 4 Factors (eFG%, TOV%, ORB%, FTr).
        * Use 55/30/15 blend (H/A, Season, Rolling) with small-sample shrink as above.
        * Build separate A/H (or neutral) offensive and defensive baselines.
2. Pace / Possessions Estimation
    * Combine team tempo and opponent tempo allowed, venue-adjusted.
    * Introduce style-clash logic:
        * Fast vs fast → allow pace +5–8% above blended mean.
        * Slow vs slow → pace −5–8%.
        * Fast vs slow → tug-of-war: pace biased toward team dictating more possessions in your sheet (press/transition tags if present).
    * Sanity-check expected possessions vs league norms; hard-cap extreme outliers.
3. 3P & FT Regression Module
    * For each team:
        * Compute Season 3P% and Recent 3P% (L5/L10); regress recent performance toward season mean:
            * Do not let recent 3P% deviate more than ±3–4 pts from season in the projection.
        * Apply similar logic to FT%:
            * Use FT Rate (FTr) + FT% to estimate expected FT scoring; regress FT% toward season/league mean.
    * Flag 3P-dependent offenses (high 3P rate in sheet) as higher volatility (V bump).
    * For large arenas / domes (Final Four / National Championship), allow a slight downward bias to 3P efficiency (sightline effect), but cap it at a small adjustment (e.g., −2–3% relative to season).
4. Usage / Availability & Rotation
    * Apply rotation info:
        * Only treat top 6–7 players (starters + 1–2 key bench) as materially impacting team efficiency.
        * Use minutes / usage from sheet where available; otherwise assume standard starter minutes.
    * Injuries:
        * If missing starter / primary creator:
            * Adjust team ORtg modestly (system-first; cap change at ~8–10% efficiency swing).
            * Increase V rather than blowing up projections.
        * If depth hit only (role player out): mostly V bump, small efficiency tweak at most.
5. Situational Overlays
    * Add travel, rest, altitude, and foul profile:
        * Extra rest days: small positive adjustment to ORtg / pace (≤2–3%).
        * Tough travel + short rest: slight ORtg and/or pace suppression (−2–4%).
    * Foul profile:
        * Whistle-heavy teams (high FTr on both O and D) → more FT variance, small bump to Total V.
    * Tournament / Series Familiarity:
        * For conference tournaments or March matchups between teams that already played 2+ times:
            * Slightly tighten variance on pace (teams know each other’s sets).
            * Allow a modest bump to defensive efficiency if both are well-scouted league foes.
            * Do not overreact to prior game results; treat them as tiny/context only, not a trend system.
6. SoS Adjustment
    * Apply SoS or opponent-adjusted ORtg/DRtg from your sheet:
        * Soften or harden previous efficiency estimates by a few percent, not wholesale rewrites.
        * Keep this as a secondary correction behind the raw blended efficiencies.
7. Simulation & Pricing
    * Using expected possessions and adjusted Off/Def efficiencies:
        * Build possession-based scoring distributions for both teams.
        * Derive mean and distribution for:
            * Team points (A/H)
            * Full-game total
            * Margin of victory
    * Convert to:
        * Fair Spread
        * Fair Total
        * Fair Moneyline (ML)
    * Compute EdgeScore vs market lines for side/total/ML.
8. Volatility Scoring (V 0–100)
    * Drivers:
        * Usage uncertainty (injury status, rotation instability, freshmen dependence)
        * Pace variance (extreme tempo clash)
        * 3P dependence + 3P regression gap
        * Foul/FT volatility (high FTr, poor FT shooters)
        * Small-conference / low-data teams
    * Guidelines:
        * V ≥ 80: exclude from “Absolute Best”; generally PASS unless edge is outrageous and well-explained.
        * V ≥ 65: downgrade confidence tier; require stronger edge.
        * V < 65: standard gates.

🔹 Picks (Price-Sensitive)
Play: <market side/total> — to <price> Confidence: High / Medium / Lean (V=##)
Why:
* [Driver 1 – e.g., blended eFG% & pace edge at venue/neutral]
* [Driver 2 – e.g., ORB% advantage vs weak defensive rebounding]
* [Driver 3 – e.g., SoS correction; opponent inflated vs weak schedule]
* [Driver 4 – e.g., 3P/FT regression angle; high FTr vs foul-prone defense]

🔹 Guardrails
* Sides / ML: require ≥ 3% price edge vs fair.
* Totals: require ≥ 3.5–4.0 point cushion vs model median (after pace + regression modules).
* Trap guardrail:
    * PASS if |Fair − Market| ≥ 9 and V ≥ 60 (treat as noise/trap).
* Maintain strict “to” numbers; no chasing beyond play-to line/price.
* “Absolute Best” only if:
    * EdgeScore ≥ 4%,
    * V < 55, and
    * Side/Total edge meets cushion rules above.
